# FCC/ES6

## Purpose
This serves as the directory with the solution to all the problems given in the [ES6 course of FCC/JDSA](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#es6)

## TODO
Put all the individual functions/expressions/whatever under one ES6 class.
Better to put all the cluster in one chaotic place with a big useless class than to have distributed chaos of small useless functions/whatever.
